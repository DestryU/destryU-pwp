<h1>Content Strategy</h1>
    <p class="indent box">
        My portfolio is meant to be a simple and clean design, with an influence on answering the basic questions and
        providing easy solutions for finding out more. The website is ideally going to be structured with two major sections,
        and each of those major sections will have further sub-sections as follows:
    </p>
    <div class="indent">
        <ul>
            <li>Splash</li>
            <li>About Me</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Who?</li>
                <li>What?</li>
                <li>Where?</li>
                <li>Why?</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Resources</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Resume & Cover</li>
                <li>Contact Me</li>
                <li>Gallery*</li>
                <li>More Examples*</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <p class="indent box">
        All of this will be presented in the form of one very tall webpage, where users land at the top and can learn
        everything they need to by scrolling down.
    </p>


<h3>Splash</h3>
<p class="indent box">
    The top of the page, the Splash, will feature a greeting, a prompt to begin scrolling down, and a quick jump button
    that lets users skip to the bottom.
</p>


<h3>About Me</h3>
<p class="indent box">
    This section is meant to be an attractive way of funneling users towards the bottom of the page, where the most
    important content is. Each sub-section is modeled after the 5 W's (I won't be using When). Each sub-section will
    be a large block-style section with a Title (who | what | where | why), a small paragraph of text that answers the
    sub-section question, and an associated space for an example that ties it all together.
</p>
<div class="indent">
    <p class="indent box">
        <strong>EX: For the WHO sub section, there will be a title clearly labeled 'Who?', a paragraph of text like the one below, and
        a professional headshot as the example:</strong>
    </p>
    <p class="indent box">
        <em>WHO:
        Hello, my name is Destry. I like books and music, I like games of both the board and video variety, and I like cartoons
        and toys. In a lot of ways, I'm still a kid that believes in make-pretend. But more important than what I like is what
        I can DO, and what I do is Interactive Design.</em>
    </p>
</div>
<p class="indent box">
    Very specifically, I want to include a Parallax scrolling effect throughout this section. Because I'm selling myself
    as a web developer, this section is meant to be the flashiest front-end I can manage; it's not just a blurb about
    who I am, but a practical demonstration of why my webdev and design skills are desirable.
</p>


<h3>Resources</h3>
<p class="indent box">
    This section is meant to be an array of options that let users find out more about me, reach out, or explore other
    things I've done. For this PWP, my final submittal will only really have a section featuring anchors for my contact
    information and resume. However, since I want to use this as my portfolio, I fully intend on expanding this section
    after final turn-in to include additional content, such as image galleries, links to other services, and more.

!! IMPORTANT !!

This is all scratch notes stuff, just ignore it:

---------------------------

Who?
Hello, my name is Destry. I like books and music, I like games of both the board and video variety, and I like cartoons
and toys. In a lot of ways, I'm still a kid that believes in make-pretend. But more important than what I like is what
I can DO, and what I do is Interactive Design.

What?
The obvious question is, 'What is Interactive Design?' That's a good question, but also kind of hard to answer. If design
is all about what happens when we reach out to touch the world around us, then... I guess you could say it's my job to
make sure the world can reach out to touch us in meaningful and engaging ways.

Can I make a 1-button game?

Where?
Everywhere! And everything! If it was made by people and for people, then it was designed in some way. Now, not
everyone is good at design - there's a lot of accidental and even plain bad design in the world. Good design is hard,
complex, and takes time. Even this button is maybe more complex than you think:

Button: hide/reveal large overlay of font choices, spacing, color, wording, interaction, psychological principles, etc.

Why?
That's exactly the thing - you don't notice good design. It's easy to notice bad design: fiddly handles or knobs and
hard to read text. But good design? Good design is invisible. No one wants to be remembered as the product that didn't
work or the website that's awful to use. Whether you're an entrepenuer thinking about your online presence or a large
corporation looking to appeal to a wider audience, you need good design. And I can help with that.
